# Pulse Architecture

## Overview

Pulse is built with a modular architecture that prioritizes security, performance, and scalability. The system is divided into several key components:

## Components

### 1. Backend Server
- Built with Rust and Tokio for async I/O
- Uses QUIC for low-latency communication
- Implements end-to-end encryption
- Handles message routing and storage
- Manages user authentication and session handling

### 2. Crypto Module
- Implements AES-256-GCM encryption
- Handles key exchange using X25519
- Manages secure random number generation
- Provides cryptographic primitives for the entire system

### 3. Mobile Client
- Native Rust implementation with platform bindings
- Secure local storage
- Efficient message synchronization
- Battery-optimized background processing

### 4. Desktop Client
- Cross-platform GUI using egui
- Native system integration
- Efficient resource management
- Seamless sync with mobile clients

## Security Architecture

### End-to-End Encryption
1. Initial key exchange using X3DH
2. Double Ratchet for forward secrecy
3. Perfect forward secrecy for group chats
4. Secure key storage using platform keychains

### Data Flow
1. Messages are encrypted on the client
2. Encrypted data is transmitted via QUIC
3. Server only handles encrypted data
4. Decryption happens only on recipient devices

## Performance Considerations

### Optimizations
- QUIC for reduced latency
- Efficient binary protocols
- Minimal metadata storage
- Optimized database queries
- Efficient message synchronization

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling of backend servers
- Efficient message routing
- Optimized storage strategies
- Load balancing support

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization
- Clear separation of concerns
- Modular design
- Comprehensive testing
- Documentation requirements

### Security Practices
- Regular security audits
- Dependency updates
- Secure coding guidelines
- Penetration testing

## Future Considerations

### Planned Features
- Voice and video calls
- AI-powered features
- Enhanced group chat capabilities
- Additional platform support
